# Leonardo Alencar

- I love programming principles in general, and on the down low, I love coding in C++;
- I’ve got an Instagram with tips that’s helped a lot of people, but I’m kinda inactive there now :(
- I’ve always tried to start my own thing and failed, but one day it’ll work out;
- My own delivery app running in Brazil: https://foodez.app.br;
- Working on a new app for Australia: https://fastaffo.com | https://fastaffo.com.au;
